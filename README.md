    # Load the dataset of ligand-protein complexes and their binding affinities

    # Split the data into training and testing sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(data.drop(['Binding Affinity'], axis=1), data['Binding Affinity'], test_size=0.2)

    print('Mean squared error:', mse)

    # Use the model to predict the binding affinity of a new ligand-protein complex
    new_data = np.array([[0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6]])  # Replace with your own data

In this code, `dataset.csv` is a CSV file containing a dataset of ligand-protein complexes and their binding affinities. The dataset should include features of the ligand and protein, such as their electrostatic properties, shape complementarity, and solvation effects. The target variable, binding affinity, should also be included.

The code first loads the dataset and splits it into training and testing sets using the `train_test_split` function from scikit-learn. It then trains a random forest regression model on the training data using the `RandomForestRegressor` class.

The model is evaluated on the testing data using the mean squared error (MSE) metric, which measures the average squared difference between the predicted and actual binding affinities.

Finally, the model is used to predict the binding affinity of a new ligand-protein complex using the **predict** method. In this example, the features of the new complex are represented as a 1D numpy array, but you can use your own data representation as long as it has the same number of features as the training data.

Note that this is just a simple example, and there are many ways to improve the performance and accuracy of a machine learning model for ligand-protein binding affinity prediction. The choice of features, model architecture, and hyperparameters can all have a significant impact on the results.
